Celebrations make life better overall by giving us something to look forward to, something enjoyable to do. It's not necessary to have an extravagant party or buy an expensive present to celebrate. This habit can be practiced in a variety of ways and is simple to incorporate into daily life. Simple methods to celebrate include keeping a success journal, treating yourself to a day of pampering, or taking loved ones out to dinner.
<br />
<br />
Like Angela, Chloe, and Airich, they celebrate their academic success when they earn good marks on quizzes, long quizzes, and other school-related tasks. They celebrate it by eating out, and doing other things they want to do.
